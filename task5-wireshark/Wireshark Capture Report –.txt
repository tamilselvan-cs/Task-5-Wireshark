-Task-5 Wireshark Capture Report – TCP Traffic

Name: C Tamilselvan
Date of Capture:  29-09-2025
Operating System: Kali Linux-Wireshark version:4.4.1

---

1. Objective
To capture live network packets and analyze the observed TCP protocol communication.

---

2. Capture Details
| Item | Value |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Interface used | eth0
| Duration | ~60 seconds |
| Total packets | 4186 packets |
| Protocols detected | TCP only |

During the capture, test traffic such as `ping`, `curl`, or normal web browsing was generated.  
All packets were identified as **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

 3. Observations
1. TCP Handshake 
   - Multiple connections show the standard 3-way handshake: `SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK`.
2. Application Layer (encrypted)  
   - Many packets carry TLS/HTTPS data inside TCP segments. Payload contents are encrypted and not human-readable.
3. Reliability
   - Sequence numbers and acknowledgements confirm ordered, reliable delivery.
4. Port Usage  
   - Common destination ports observed:  
     - 443 – HTTPS web traffic  

---

 4. Key Insights
- TCP provides **connection-oriented** and **reliable** communication between client and server.
- Even when visiting secure websites, Wireshark can show **TCP headers** (IP addresses, ports, flags) but cannot read encrypted payload.

## 5. Files Included
- `screenshots/` – Wireshark interface and TCP analysis
- `report.md` – this report

---

## 6. Conclusion
The capture demonstrates that modern web activity primarily uses TCP as the transport layer, ensuring reliable data transfer.  

All packets displayed expected handshake and acknowledgment behavior, with no packet loss or retransmission anomalies observed in this short test
